# ArgoCD-Demo-Application

This repository hosts the demonstrative application code for the [Argo CD Demo](https://github.com/Skalador/ArgoCD-Demo).

Three versions of NGINX, i.e. `1.0`, `1.1` and `1.2`, are stored in this repo. Each `index.html` files is slightly different. For each version there is a dedicated `Dockerfile`. The `Dockerfiles` are built via `Github Actions` and pushed to [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/skalador).
